This is a private hackathon open to UmojaHack Algeria participants. If you are a university student in Algeria and would like to participate, contact Zindi Ambassador Abderaouf Gacem.

Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Yassir rely on real-time data and machine learning algorithms to automate their services. Accurately predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for Yassir trips will make Yassir’s services more reliable and attractive; this will have a direct and indirect impact on both customers and business partners. The solution would help the company save money and allocate more resources to other parts of the business.

The objective of this hackathon is to predict the estimated time of arrival at the dropoff point for a single Yassir journey.
